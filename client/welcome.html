			<p> <span id="enlargeDate">June 1st, 2015 Incident #1 </span> I woke up excited to finally begin my summer of learning to code/build actual apps for the JBS program at Brandeis having spent nearly a month doing absolutely nothing productive at home, there was nothing I could have wished for more. Upon pulling up to the theater lot I saw an open spot next to this grey Honda civic and I decided to park next to it assuming nothing of their placement in the spacings. Boy was I wrong. Not only did this person miss the spot and takeup two others they didn't even pull in far enough.  </p>

			<p> <span id="enlargeDate">June 8th, 2015 Incident #2 </span> Alright a week has gone by and I had forgotten all about that horrendous parking incident. As I pulled up to the theater lot for anothering 'exciting day' at Brandeis I noticed the same gray honda civic but this time parked closer to the walking ramp. As I got closer... oh no... he/she/it did it again.... Given this person's so far consistent failure at parking their car properly on Mondays, I figured I would have enough material this summer to document maybe their progress.
