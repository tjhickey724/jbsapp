					<p>    We are dedicated to assist Chinese students who want to apply for colleges in U.S. Now, many Chinese students are considering apply for colleges aboard, but they are confused about the application process and are misled by many information online. Many of them are unable to visit the colleges in U.S before they make their final decision. We hope these students will be able to gain information about each college as accurate as American students. We want to pair them with current college students in U.S., so they can hear about their experience and learn more about these colleges. </p>
